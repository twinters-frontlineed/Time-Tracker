## File Structure

- `main.js` - Electron main process
- `preload.js` - Secure communication bridge
- `renderer.js` - Timer logic and UI interactions
- `index.html` - App interface
- `styles.css` - Styling and layout
- `package.json` - Project configuration

## Data Storage

The app uses `electron-store` to save:
- Your list of Jira tickets
- Time tracking sessions
- Window position and size
- Current timer state

Data is stored locally on your computer in:
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\jira-time-tracker\config.json`

## Building for Distribution

To create a distributable version:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create an installer in the `dist` folder.

## Customization

You can easily customize the app by modifying:
- `styles.css` - Change colors, sizes, fonts
- `renderer.js` - Modify timer behavior or add features
- `main.js` - Adjust window properties or add system integration

## Troubleshooting

**App won't start:**
- Make sure Node.js is installed
- Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed

**Data not saving:**
- Check that the app has write permissions to the user data directory

**Window lost off-screen:**
